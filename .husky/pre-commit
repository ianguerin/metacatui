npm test -- --silent || (echo "\n****\n\nMetacatUI uses a pre-commit hook to run unit tests locally.
We do this to avoid additional hassle during pull request reviews as all pull requests must pass these checks anyways.

If you're checking in some work-in-progress code, then you can bypass these checks:
    git commit --no-verify

To run the tests locally without committing you can run:
    $ npm run test
Or to view the tests in a web browser:
    $ npm run view-tests
"; exit 1)
